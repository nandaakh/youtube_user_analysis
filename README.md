# youtube_user_analysis
This project is an analysis of data related to YouTube users. The dataset used contains information regarding video comments and statistics. The background to this project is to gain deeper insights into YouTube user behavior, as well as the relationship between keyword categories and views, likes, and comment sentiment.

The purpose of this data analysis is to explore the YouTube dataset and generate useful information. By analyzing comment data and video statistics, we can find out which videos are the most commented on or liked by users. Apart from that, we can also see the total views and the number of likes each keyword category has. In the context of comment sentiment, the goal is to find out which comments are most liked. Also, by comparing views and likes per video in each category, we can look at the view/like rate to get a deeper understanding of user preferences for videos in each category.

This project provides a comprehensive overview of available YouTube data and provides valuable insights for further analysis and decision making.
